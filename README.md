## 🌲 Forest Fire Prediction 🔥

This is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the risk of a forest fire based on environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen level, and humidity. 🌡️💨 The model provides a real-time prediction of whether a forest is in danger or safe from fire. The app also includes the probability of the prediction. 🔍

## Features ✨

- **🔥 Prediction of Fire Risk**: Predicts whether a forest is in danger of a fire based on input features.
- **📊 Probability**: Displays the probability of fire risk along with the prediction.
- **🌿 Background Change**: Changes the background image based on the prediction (forest in danger or safe).
- **📝 Interactive Form**: A user-friendly interface where users can input environmental data.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **🐍 Python**: Programming language used to build the machine learning model and Flask web application.
- **⚡ Flask**: A web framework used to develop the application.
- **📚 Scikit-learn**: A library used to train the machine learning model.
- **🌐 HTML/CSS**: Used for designing the frontend of the web application.
- **📦 Pickle**: Used to save and load the trained model.
